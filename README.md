## What I Learned 

useLocation() hook for react-router-dom allowed me to conditionally render certain UI elements according to the current path.

Picture elements weren't displaying correctly when deployed to AWS Amplify. Found the fix [here] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64146914/react-images-load-locally-but-not-on-aws-amplify).

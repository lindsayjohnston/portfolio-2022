<intro>This is a quick and dirty guide to making you a web developer in the next 9 minutes.
   Set your timer, and let’s get nerdy. </intro>
<prereqs>
   A computer, Internet browser (Chrome - Safari - Firefox etc.),Some sort of text editor (Notepad comes standard on
   Windows and TextEdit on Mac)
</prereqs>
<steps>
   <step>{"stepTitle" : "STEP 1: MAKE AN HTML FILE", "stepContent":
      "
      <p>
         Open a text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac. If you already have an
         <a>https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide, IDE</a> set up
         (like VisualStudio Code) you can use that as well.
      </p>
      <important>
         Don’t use something like Word or Pages, the “whitespace” on a fancy document editor will be full of
         invisible,
         extra code that may mess up your simple website.
      </important>
      <p>
         Copy the snippet below into the text editor:
      </p>
<code>
<!DOCTYPE html>\n
<html lang=\"en\">\n
<head>\n
   <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n
   <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n
   <title>Baby’s First Website</title>\n
</head>\n
<body>\n
   Write whatever you like here. This is your first website: make it count!\n
</body>\n
</html>
</code>
      <important>
         Even as a seasoned web developer, I still copy and paste this “markdown” snippet every
         time I create a webpage from scratch.
         Reserve your memory for mom’s birthday and Google everything else.
      </important>
      <p>
         Feel free to edit the text in the <strong>

            <body>
         </strong> and <strong>
            <title>
         </strong> tags to
         whatever your heart desires. “Hello world” is a classic.
      </p>
      <p>
         Save this as an “.html” file.
      </p>
      <img>{\"alt\": \"save to html example\", \"src\":
      \"https://portfolio-2023.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/BlogPostMedia/CreateYourFirstWebpage/save-to-html.png\" }</img>
      <important>
         “Index.html” is the super boring name that most websites use for their HTML foundation.
         You could call it “web-borgs-r-us.html” if you like.
      </important>

<step>
{"stepTitle": "STEP 2: OPEN YOUR FIRST WEBPAGE",
"stepContent": "
         <p>
            Click on the file you just saved. Most computers are smart enough to try to open “.html” files in a web
            browser.
            You should see your first-ever, hand-rolled webpage.
         </p>
         <img>{\"alt\": \"simple webpage\", \"src\": \"https://portfolio-2023.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/BlogPostMedia/CreateYourFirstWebpage/webpage-image.png\"}</img>
         
         <p>
            Notice how the text in the <strong><title></strong> tag corresponds with the text that shows up in the
            browser tab and how the text in the
            <strong> <body></strong> tag shows up on the page. Play around with these. Have a little fun!

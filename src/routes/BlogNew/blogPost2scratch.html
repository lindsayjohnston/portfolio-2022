   we created a webpage using the text editor that came with our computer.

   <a>https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide,Integrated Development Environment</a>, 
   also known as an “IDE.”
</intro>
<important>
   Programmers LOVE using acronyms almost as much as they love poor communication. 
   If you forget what IDE means, flip all the gatekeepers the bird, 
   and feel free to call your IDE “the place where I write code.”
